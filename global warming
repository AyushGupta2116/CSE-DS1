  <h1>Global Warming</h1>

  <p>Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's surface and atmosphere, mainly caused by human activities [2].</p>

  <div class="causes">
    <h2>What causes it?</h2>
    <p>The main cause is the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases, like carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and methane ($CH_4$), trap heat from the sun. Human activities that release these gases include burning fossil fuels (like coal and oil) for energy and deforestation [1, 2, 13].</p>

  <div class="impacts">
    <h2>What are the impacts?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Rising global temperatures</li>
      <li>Melting glaciers and ice sheets</li>
      <li>Rising sea levels</li>
      <li>More extreme weather events (like floods, droughts, and heatwaves) [1, 6, 15]</li>
      <li>Threats to ecosystems and biodiversity [6]</li>
    </ul>
